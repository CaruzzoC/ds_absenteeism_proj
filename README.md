# Data Science Excessive Absenteeism Estimator : Project Overview

## Presentation

In a society where productivity is key, I did a project in which we could predict who is most likely to be absent and so, take action before it happends.\
The goal is to know whether a person present certain characteristics preliminary of an absenteeism.

At the end, we would get an answer whether someone will probably be excessively absent or not :
  **0:** will probably not be excessively absent.
  **1:** will probably be absent.

## Summary

* Created a tool that estimates possible excessive absenteeism with a score of 75% which would help preventing it.
* Used real world data.
* cleaned and made sense of the data.
* Engineered features to get the most out of the given data.
* Built a module for fast and easy integration.
* Used the predictions to find an indicator of future absenteeism and get insight from Tableau integration.
